Generate a complete inference code implementation for a machine learning model.

TRAINING CODE:
```python
{{ training_code }}
```

INPUT SCHEMA:
{{ input_schema }}

OUTPUT SCHEMA:
{{ output_schema }}

PREDICTOR INTERFACE:
```python
{{ predictor_interface_source }}
```

PREDICTOR TEMPLATE:
```python
{{ predictor_template }}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to create a complete inference implementation based on the training code above.
The code should implement the PredictorImplementation class following the Predictor interface.
The implementation must handle loading model artifacts, preprocessing inputs, making predictions,
and formatting outputs according to the specified schemas.

{{ instructions }}

Ensure your code:
1. Properly loads all model artifacts created during training
2. Correctly preprocesses input data to match what the model expects
3. Makes predictions using the loaded model
4. Formats output according to the output schema
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Is well-documented with docstrings
7. Follows Python best practices

Return ONLY the complete Python code without any explanations.
