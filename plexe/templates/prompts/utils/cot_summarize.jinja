Your task is to examine details about a reasoning step taken by an engineer and generate:
1. A short, friendly title (3-8 words) that captures the essence of what happened
2. A concise summary (exactly 2 sentences) that explains the step in plain language

Example:
Step Type: Thinking
Thought: I need to analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between features. Let me look at the correlation matrix to identify patterns.
Tool: pandas_describe({"dataframe": df})
Observation: The dataset has 5000 rows and 15 columns. There's a strong correlation between age and income.

Would generate:
Title: "Analyzing Dataset Relationships"
Summary: "I examined the dataset's correlation matrix to identify patterns between features. I found a strong correlation between them age and income, which could be important for my analysis."

Context:
{{ context }}

Instructions:
- Focus on capturing the main action/purpose of the step
- In the summary, state both the thought/action and the result
- Title should be 3-8 words
- Summary should be 2 sentences
- Include specific details (e.g., feature names, patterns found) so that it's clear what the OUTCOME is
- Speak in the first person and present tense, as if the engineer is speaking, e.g. "I'm analyzing..." or "I found...".
- Use friendly and approachable language, feel free to use a few emojis here and there but not excessively
