Your task is to examine details about a reasoning step taken by an engineer and generate:
1. A clear, professional title (3-8 words) that captures the essence of what happened
2. A concise summary (exactly 2 sentences) that explains the step in technical terms

Example:
Step Type: Thinking
Thought: I need to analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between features. Let me look at the correlation matrix to identify patterns.
Tool: pandas_describe({"dataframe": df})
Observation: The dataset has 5000 rows and 15 columns. There's a strong correlation between age and income.

Would generate:
Title: "Analyzing Dataset Relationships"
Summary: "I analyzed the dataset's correlation matrix to identify feature relationships. I observed a strong correlation between age and income, which is relevant for further analysis."

Context:
{{ context }}

Instructions:
- Focus on capturing the main technical action/purpose of the step
- In the summary, state both the thought/action and the result in precise, technical language
- Title should be 3-8 words
- Summary should be 2 sentences
- Include specific technical details (e.g., feature names, patterns found) to clearly convey the outcome
- Use first-person and present tense, e.g., "I analyze..." or "I observe..."
- Maintain a professional and concise tone, avoiding unnecessary embellishments or informal language
