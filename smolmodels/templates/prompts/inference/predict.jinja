We are writing Python code to expose a ML model for inference. The model is wrapped in a class called
"PredictorImplementation". Here is some context about the model:

## Output Schema
The "predict()" function in PredictorImplementation must conform with this output schema:
```python
{{ output_schema }}
```

## Input Schema
The "predict()" function in PredictorImplementation receives an input matching the following schema:
```python
{{ input_schema }}
```

## Original Training Code
The model was trained using the following code:
```python
{{ training_code }}
```

## Inference Script (Work in Progress)
Here is the inference script that we are working on:
```python
{{ inference_code }}
```

## Task
Your task is to complete the "predict()" function in the inference script. Note that the model loading is already
done in the __init__ constructor, and input preprocessing logic has also been added already. Your job is to
implement the prediction logic. The function should:

1. Take preprocessed input data from the preprocessing step
2. Use the loaded model to make predictions
3. Format the predictions according to the output schema
4. Return an output matching the output schema

Do not modify the model loading code or other existing parts of the code, only implement the prediction logic. Return
the full inference script, with the "predict()" function completed.
